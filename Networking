#Networking fandamentals
## Topics Covered
- OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
- IP Addressing and MAC Address
- Routers, Switches, and Firewalls
- Ports and Protocols
- Client-Server Architecture

## OSI Model
The OSI model has 7 layers:
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## TCP/IP Model
The TCP/IP model has 4 layers:
1. Network Interface
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

## Difference
OSI is a theoretical model, while TCP/IP is a practical model used in real networks.

## IP Address
An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
Types:
- IPv4
- IPv6

## MAC Address
A MAC address is a physical address assigned to a network interface card.
It works at the Data Link layer.

## Router
Connects different networks and works at Layer 3.

## Switch
Connects devices within the same network and works at Layer 2.

## Firewall
Provides security by allowing or blocking traffic based on rules.

## Common Ports
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443
- FTP: 21
- SSH: 22
- DNS: 53

## Protocols
- TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented
- UDP: Fast, connectionless

## Client-Server Architecture
A client sends requests to a server, and the server responds.
Example:
- Web browser (Client)
- Web server (Server)

Used in web applications, databases, and enterprise systems.
